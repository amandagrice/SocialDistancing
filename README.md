# SocialDistancing

## Description

A silly I made while bored out of my mind during the covid-19 quarantine. The goal is to collect all the groceries you need in a store, without getting too close to anyone who's infected. 

Practice social distancing! If you get close to a zombie, you lose. If you collect all the groceries in the area, you win. Good luck!
